      <title>Database integration tests for a Spring application</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Suppose you are tasked with writing tests for a Spring and Hibernate application. This application uses a mix of native queries, HQL or entity associations to fetch data from the database. If you choose to mock the DAO or entity layers, you leave a significant portion of the code untested. In such cases data integration tests can provide the most correct feedback. But you do you configure your application to run integration tests?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Setting up a JavaScript project in 2017</title>

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Creating a front-end JavaScript project can be a daunting task due to the sheer volume of choices available while deciding the tech stack. First, you need to decide the JavaScript framework or library for your project. Do you plan to use the latest ES2015 language features in your code? If yes, then you need a transpiler because your browser probably doesn’t support them yet. Then you require a bundling tool to get your code loaded in the browser. You may want to minify the code for faster load time. To automate all these steps, you need a build script. You may want to deploy your project on a local web server during development. Some setup is required for that. Finally, you need to include some testing framework in your project to write unit tests.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How unit testing leads to improved code</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Test Driven Development, the purpose of unit testing is to help us design our classes and not just to validate the correctness of our code. In this article I want to demonstrate how unit testing forces us to write better code, with help of an example. I will use Mockito for mocking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, let me define the problem domain I’ll be using in the example. Suppose we have an online booking portal where customers make reservations for travel or accommodation. Whenever a new reservation is created, its details are added to an XML which is kept at some location. Periodically, we need to fetch all the reservations that have been created in our system and send for printing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
