      <description>Suppose you are tasked with writing tests for a Spring and Hibernate application. This application uses a mix of native queries, HQL or entity associations to fetch data from the database. If you choose to mock the DAO or entity layers, you leave a significant portion of the code untested. In such cases data integration tests can provide the most correct feedback. But you do you configure your application to run integration tests?</description>

      <description>Aspect oriented programming (AOP) is a way of separating the business login in your code from cross cutting concerns. What is a cross cutting concern?
Analogy time. A typical house has different rooms that have designated functions. We keep our stuff in the rooms where they make sense. The living room is an unlikely location for a dishwasher and a bathtub belongs in the bathroom. But the electric circuit runs throughout the house because it is not tied to the functionality of any specific room.</description>

      <description>In a relational database, the relationships between two tables are defined by foreign keys. Typically, one table has a column that contains the primary key of another tableâ€™s row. In JPA, we deal with entity objects that are Java representations of database tables. So we need a different way for establishing relationship between two entities. JPA entity relationships define how these entities refer to each other.
For the purpose of this article, I will work with JPA 2.</description>
